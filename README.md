Basic Port Scanner â€“ Python Project

A simple command-line port scanner written in Python. It allows users to scan a range of TCP ports on a target IP address or hostname to check which ports are open.
This tool is useful for learning the basics of networking, sockets, and Python scripting. It handles common errors like unreachable hosts, network timeouts, and user interrupts.
